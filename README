A Java-based interface for queue implementations, along with two implementations of the interface.

1. In-memory implementation: 
	- Uses a ConcurrentLinkedQueue for in-memory storage
	- Uses a com.google.common.cache.Cache for intermediate storage of consumed messages and automatic eviction

2. File-based implementation: 
	- The file path is specified in config/config.properties as the ”path” property. 
	- Uses a com.google.common.cache.Cache for intermediate storage of consumed messages and automatic eviction
